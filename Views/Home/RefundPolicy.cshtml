    All our services and tools are delivered digitally. Once a subscription is activated or a calculation feature is accessed, it is considered delivered and consumed.

    We may consider a refund only in the following exceptional cases:
</p>
<ul>

    <li>Technical issues that prevent access to the tool, which cannot be resolved within 7 business days</li>
</ul>
